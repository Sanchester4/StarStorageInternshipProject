This is a console program which is based on a few crucial moments:
1. It is needed to initialise the program with a input JSON file, and after parse all data to the MySQL database and perform around 12 methods passed in console by user. I used 
Regex to recognize all the methods and a simple loop with Scanner to read each line of inputed name of methods with parameters.

PRINT PRODUCTS CATEGORY ${CATEGORY_NAME} - print all products of a specific category;

PRINT PRODUCTS ALL - print all products with a row number generated by a loop;

PRINT PRODUCTS ${PRODUCTS_NAME} - print product with specific name

PRINT CATEGORIES - print all categories

BUY ${PRODUCT} ${QUANTITY} FOR ${USERNAME} - buy a product 

REPLENISH ${PRODUCT} ${QUANTITY} - update the quantity , but cannot excces the maxQuantity

ADD NEW CATEGORY ${NAME} - add a  new category , getting error message if name of category is already used in the table. 

ADD NEW PRODUCT ${NAME} ${CATEGORY} ${QUANTITY} ${PRICE} - add new product if a category already exist or recently added, getting error message if inputed category doesn't exist. 

REMOVE PRODUCT ${NAME} - remove a product if his quantity is zero 

PRINT DISPLAY_MODE - print the actual PrintStream, the console or the FILE_PATH

SWITCH DISPLAY_MODE CONSOLE or FILE ${FILE_PATH} - called with parameter of FILE_PATH , we are create or rewriting the JSON FILE with logs.

EXPORT ${FILE_NAME} - exporting the actual mysql tables with data of database, we also can initialise our program with this file

2. There was a neccesarry to perform an certain logic that will simulate such complex method as buying or add new product .
3. And a logic that will perform the append() of date to each line of output when is called SWITCH DISPLAY_MODE FILE ${FILE_PATH}
